# SDE-CAW-TODO

### Objective:
Build a simple Todo App using React with local state management and write unit tests using Jest and
React Testing Library.
### Requirements:
##### 1. Core Functionality:
*  The app should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
*  Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed.
*  Filter tasks by "All," "Completed," and "Pending."
##### 2. React Components:
*  Separate components for adding tasks, listing tasks, and filtering tasks.
*  Maintain state in a top-level component (using React useState).
##### 3. Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for each React component using Jest and React Testing Library.
Ensure that tests cover:
*  Adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
*  Proper task completion toggling.
*  Filter functionality (showing only completed/pending tasks when selected).

##### 4. Bonus (Optional):
 Implement local storage to persist tasks across page reloads.
